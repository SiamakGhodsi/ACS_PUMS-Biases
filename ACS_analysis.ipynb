    "In this notebok we provide experiments on the new adult-census datastes to study the discriminatory behavior of a Machine Learning model (e.g., Logsitic Regresion) on the mentioned data. We study how discriminatory the outcomes of a model trained on a state's data will be when deployed on the data of other states and further generalize the experiments on the whole US data. The discriminatory outcomes are quantified based on the \"Race\" protectede attribute in the sense of the difference of True-Positive Rates for three racial groups of <b>\"White\"</b>, <b>\"non-Wthie\"</b>, and <b>\"Black\"</b>. Then we will investigate how bias mitigation interventions can be employed and to what extent can they be efficient in terms of fair outcomes for different protected groups. \n",
    "\n",
    "The experiments include: \n",
    " - Train a model on the <b>2019</b> data of the most populated state of the US, the <b>California</b>-state and deploy it on each of the states as well as the <b>whole US</b>, separately. Then comparing the outcomes (i.e., overall Accuracy and group-wise TPR difference) of the Ca-Model on different states and the whole country including the two states with the least and the most TPR-differences in the racial groups predictions (<i><b>Oklahama</i></b> & <i><b>Indiana</i></b>, respectively). The results are shown in Bar-charts and Boxplots.\n",
    " - Furthermore, I train a model on each state and deploy on all the other states including the initial state itself. It sums to n<sup>2</sup> tests. Then I summarize the distribution of the group-wise TPR differences in boxplots again in comparison with the <b>US-wide</b> model.\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Next studies can be: Age and gender inequalities\n",
    " - Utilization of a fair-LR model and compare with the initial model's outcomes\n",
    " - Adding the temporal information to the problem (how to best use thses info)\n",
    " - Usage of neighborhood information to augment current task. Using a CNN, the information of neighboring states can be employed as augmentation for the current task  \n",
    " - A spatio-temporal model like the [Taxi-demand prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.08714.pdf) \n",
